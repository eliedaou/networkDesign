Elie’s contribution


* sender.java 
* SendingStateMachine
* SendManager
* ServerReceived


For this phase, a lot of work was done by Grant. He explained the majority of it to me. 
A lot of my code was heavily inspired by his code. 
Both Elie and Grant contributed to a lot, a LOT, of troubleshooting and “bug squashing”. Collaborated through the night until my our heads hit the table (mine actually did).

Partner rating 5, great, amazing. 
He did a lot more than I did. I was way over my head confused and he put in more effort than I can say I would have if I was in his situation. 
I did not plan my time very well. I was the anchor in this partnership.
